# CSCI-2910-Lab5
# API Used: https://github.com/5e-bits/5e-srd-api

2/20/24 Began work on project. Copied API call from developer resources. Researched.
2/21/24 Decided to make a small encyclopedia using the API and Console App functionality.<nl>
        Since this API is GET-only, I will focus on simply pulling info from it.
        Couldn't create a class named "Class" as things would get confusing, and i'm not sure it's a good idea, so I just named it PlayerClass. This is sure to cause some problems further down the line.
