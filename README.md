# CSCI-2910-Lab5
## API Used: https://github.com/5e-bits/5e-srd-api

Began work on project. Copied API call from developer resources. Researched.<br>
Decided to make a small encyclopedia using the API and Console App functionality.<br>
Since this API is GET-only, I will focus on simply pulling info from it.<br>
Couldn't create a class named "Class" as things would get confusing, and i'm not sure it's a good idea, so I just named it PlayerClass. This is sure to cause some problems further down the line.<br>
I've run into some problems- i'm sure I just don't quite understand GETing from an API. The developer recommended GraphQL, so I will be reading up on that.<br>
GraphQL is cool, but not what I need. I'll keep it in mind for future projects. In the meantime I'm going to figure out RESTful APIs like I should have from the start. Messing around with it did give me some ideas however, mostly having to do with the attributes I would like to get from the objects I pull from the API.<br>
Started using Microsoft's documentation for help with this and it's made things much easier. Working on a GET method using C#'s asynchronous http client methods. <br>
